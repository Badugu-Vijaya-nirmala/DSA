Leetcode Challenge - Reverse Linked List
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3]
# 1 => 2 => 3
 
Output: [3,2,1]
# 3 => 2 => 1

Example 2:
Input: head = [4,5]
# 4 => 5
 
Output: [5,4]
# 5 => 4

program:
def reverseList(head):
    prev = None
    while head:
        next = head.next
        head.next = prev
        prev = head
        head = next
    return prev
